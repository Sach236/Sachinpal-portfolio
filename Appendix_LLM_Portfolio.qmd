##  Commentary on Revisions

I used the outline provided by the LLM as the basic structure for my MBA portfolio. However, I made several key modifications:

- **About Me:** Rewritten completely to reflect my actual academic and professional journey, with a tone that sounds more personal and intentional.
- **Education and Experience:** Real dates, institutions, and job descriptions were added to replace the generic placeholders.
- **Skills:** The LLM gave no detailed input here, so I curated the list based on my actual strengths (e.g., administrative operations, data tools).
- **Contact Section:** Filled in accurate and active contact details.

These changes ensured my portfolio is both **authentic** and **professionally relevant** while still benefiting from the initial structure provided by the LLM.

##  Summary

The LLM helped me quickly scaffold my portfolio layout and tone, but I made all edits to ensure it represents my real profile, personality, and career direction.
